## About

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game that evolves based on its initial state, requiring no further input.

### Rules

The universe is a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which is either alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal). At each step in time:

1. **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
2. **Survival**: Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
3. **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
4. **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell

## Features

- âœ¨ Interactive grid for creating custom patterns
- ðŸŽ® Simulation controls (Start, Pause, Resume, Step, Reset)
- ðŸ“‚ Load predefined patterns from files
- âš¡ Adjustable simulation speed
- ðŸŽ¨ Intuitive GUI with gradient buttons
- ðŸ”„ Toroidal (wrap-around) grid topology

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11** or higher
- **Gradle** (or use the included Gradle wrapper)

## Building the Project

### Using Gradle Wrapper (Recommended)

On Unix/Linux/macOS:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

On Windows:
```cmd
gradlew.bat build
```

### Using System Gradle

```bash
gradle build
```

This will:
- Compile all source files
- Run unit tests
- Create a JAR file in `build/libs/`

## Running the Application

### Method 1: Using Gradle

On Unix/Linux/macOS:
```bash
./gradlew run
```

On Windows:
```cmd
gradlew.bat run
```

### Method 2: Using the JAR file

After building:
```bash
java -jar build/libs/game-of-life-2.0.0.jar
```

### Method 3: Direct execution

```bash
java -cp build/classes/java/main com.gameoflife.GameOfLifeApp
```

## Running Tests

Execute all unit tests:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

View test report:
```bash
./gradlew test --info
```

Test reports are generated in `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`

## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. Launch the application
2. Click **"Enter Simulation"** on the start screen
3. Create patterns by clicking on cells in the grid
4. Use the control buttons to run the simulation

### Controls

- **Start**: Begin the simulation with the current pattern
- **Pause**: Pause the running simulation
- **Resume**: Continue a paused simulation
- **Next Generation**: Step through one generation at a time
- **Reset**: Clear the grid and reset to generation 1
- **Clear**: Remove all living cells
- **Open File**: Load a pattern from a `.life` file
- **Add Cells Mode**: Click and drag to add cells
- **Remove Cells Mode**: Click and drag to remove cells

### Speed Control

Adjust simulation speed using the speed selector:
- **Low**: 2 generations per second
- **Medium**: 4 generations per second
- **High**: 8 generations per second
- **Extreme**: 16 generations per second
- **Custom**: Set your own speed (1-1000 GPS)

### Loading Patterns

The `Life Patterns/` directory contains pre-made patterns organized by type:

- **Oscillators**: Patterns that repeat (pulsar, blinker, etc.)
- **Spaceships**: Patterns that move across the grid
- **Still**: Static patterns that don't change
- **Gliders**: Small moving patterns
- **Puffers**: Patterns that leave debris behind
- **And more...**

To load a pattern:
1. Click **"Open File"**
2. Navigate to a pattern file
3. Select and open it
